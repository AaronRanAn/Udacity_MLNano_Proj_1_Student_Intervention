In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose **Logistic Regression, SVM and Ensemble Methods (Gradient Boosting)**.\n",

    "\n",
    "1) Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. *(You may need to do a small bit of research for this â€” give references!)* \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most ubiquitous and cannonical usage of logistic regression in the industry is Click Through Rate (CTR) Prediction. *(See one good example [here](https://turi.com/learn/gallery/notebooks/click_through_rate_prediction_intro.html))* Logistic Regression makes a great candidate for this use case due to its speed and robustness, which make it easy to implement in the system with a fairly decent accuracy. Also, one of the great merits of Logistic Regression is that its output is interpretable similar to linear regression. Interpretability isn't well covered objective in Machine Learning education, but it is really important in the industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Fast training time\n",
    "- Easily interpretable\n",
    "- Less prone to overfitting\n",
    "- Perform well in binary classification\n",
    "\n",
    "3) What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Poor performance in more complex relationship\n",
    "- Essentially a binary classifier\n",
    "- Hard to hack for multi-class classification\n",
    "- have to pick a cut-off for final labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "4) What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "- data is fairly low dimensional, about 400 rowsa nd 30 features, a fast and naive learner like Logistic Regression will make a decent effort\n",

    "1) Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. *(You may need to do a small bit of research for this â€” give references!)* \n",
    "\n",
    "To be honest and from experience, I feel like SVM can be used in the most cases where Logistic Regression is deployed in the industry, which could be probably be summarized as a relatively less complex binary classification problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well? \n",
    "\n",
    "- SVM can model more complex, nonlinear relationships than the ones Logistic Regress can.\n",
    "- Due to the fact that SVM maximize margin, SVM turned out to be more robust to noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modeling tuning is hard due to the choice of kernel function, training takes a longer time.\n",
    "- SVM is more \"black-box\" than logistic regression, the model is hard to explain and interprete. \n",
    "- Similar to Logistic Regression, SVM is inherently a binary classifier. \n",
    "- High dimensional large volumn of data, where class are not easily separatable. \n",

    "4) What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",

    "SVM seems a reasonable step up from Logistic Regression considering our data is fairly small and low dimensional, so we can leverage the fact that SVM can handle more complex classification relationship, but won't suffer from trading off too much training time. \n",

    "Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    "- Create the F<sub>1</sub> scoring function using `make_scorer` and store it in `f1_scorer`.\n",
    " - Set the `pos_label` parameter to the correct value!\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using `f1_scorer` as the scoring method, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_obj`."
